                    <h1>FIRE HAZARD</h1>
                    
                    <p>Every circumstance or setting that raises the possibility of fire or combustion is referred to as a fire hazard. Everything that has the potential to start or spread a fire is a possible fire starter, including combustible items, electrical issues, heat sources, smoking, and a variety of other things. The type and quantity of the material used, the location and environment in which it is utilized, and the likelihood of igniting sources all affect how serious a fire threat is. There are fire risks everywhere, including in businesses, homes, and public locations.</p>

                <h1>FIRE PREPAREDNESS</h1>
                <p>Fire is one of the most common disasters. In the year 2022 alone, the Philippines recorded a total of 13,029 fire-related disasters (Caliwan, 2022). However, our safety concerning fires is dependent on our knowledge of safety measures and prevention techniques, along with our ability to remain vigilant and exercise caution.</p>

                <h1 id="fr">FREQUENCY OF FIRE DISASTERS</h1>
                <p>The frequency of fires in the Philippines fluctuates from year to year and is influenced by a variety of elements, including the climate, human activity, and the accessibility of fire safety precautions. 13,584 fire incidents were reported in the Philippines in 2020, down from 16,774 in 2019, according to the Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP). The majority of fires in the Philippines, according to the BFP, are started by electrical issues, open flames, and unattended cooking. Arson, smoking, and fireworks are among other causes of fires. Urban regions experience more fires, especially in densely populated areas where there is a larger chance of a fire spreading quickly. The BFP and other Philippine organizations are working to limit the number of fires.</p>

            <p>The Manor Hotel fire incident occurred on August 18, 2011, in Quezon City, Philippines. A fire broke out in the hotel, killing ten people and injuring several others.

            <h1>KENTEX SLIPPER MANUFACTURING FIRE</h1>
            <p>The Kentex slipper manufacturing fire incident occurred on May 13, 2015, in Valenzuela City, Philippines. A fire broke out in the Kentex factory, killing 74 people and injuring several others. The fire was caused by sparks from welding work and was exacerbated by the highly flammable materials used in the factory and the lack of proper fire safety measures, such as sufficient exits and fire extinguishers.

It also led to calls for stronger enforcement of labor and safety regulations to prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future.</p>
